    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    " - Add index to mission records;\n",
    " - Permute reversed timestamps;\n",
    " - First cleansing of city names;\n",
    " - Split multiple destinations (origin is assumed to be unique): mission becomes travel;\n",
    " - Expand destinations;\n",
    " - Second cleansing of all city names;\n",
    " - Fill missing origin using Brussels as default;\n",
    " - Manually correct about 100 mispelled cities;\n",
    " - Geocode cleansed city names;\n",
    " - Add index to travel records;\n",
    " - Building geometries with Coordinate Reference System EPSG:4326;\n",
    " - Computing Geodesic Distance in km between geometries using WGS-84 ellipsoid as reference;\n",
    "\n",
    "### To do\n",
    "\n",
    " - Fill missing travel types and merge with carbon coefficients;\n",
    " - Assess magnitude of different errors affecting distance and time to see where most of the effort should be spent;\n",
    " - Sequence travel with multiple destinations instead of considering as multiple distinct travels;\n",
    " - Do we double distance as agent must return (how do we know if it has already returned?);\n",
    " - Precisly define how long mission are handled;\n",
    " - Precisly define how mission with multiple destination are handled;\n",
    " - Check long distance around 18000 km are relevant (eg. Australia: has Vincity algorithm converged?);\n",
    " - Find Flight Distance table if any available;\n",
    " - How do we fill travel type when information lacks (distance criterion?);\n",
    " - Compute insightful metrics such as distance/elasped\n",
    " - Does PHILA stand for PHILO (typo)? \n",
